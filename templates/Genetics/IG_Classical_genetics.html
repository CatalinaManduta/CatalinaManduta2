    <h3>Genetics subdivisions</h3>
    <p> Genetics is divided in 4 big subcategories  which will be presented below:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Classical genetics</li>
        <li> Molecular genetics</li>
        <li> Population genetics</li>
        <li> Quantitative genetics</li>
    </ol>
     <h3>Classical genetics</h3>
    <p> Classical genetics focuses on how traits (phenotypes) are passed down and how they work, without
        needing to know the specific details about the genes, proteins, or other molecules involved. It's like figuring
        out how something works by observing what you can see (like physical traits or behaviors) without needing to
        understand the inner workings or the exact parts that make it happen.

        </div>
        <div class="word-box-description">
            <p>Phenotype is what you can see or measure in an organism, like its eye color, height, or how it behaves.
                It's how the genes and environment together make the organism look or act.

        <h4>Cell biology</h4>

        <p>Even though it is not necessary to understand cell biology to be able to understand classical genetics,
            this would be a great start in order to have a deeper understanding of the subject.
        <p>There are two big groups of organisms:</p>
        <p><strong>Prokaryotes:</strong> These are the organisms whose cells do not have a nucleus.
            Because of that, their DNA floats freely cell's cytoplasm.</p>
        <p><strong>Eukaryotes:</strong> On the other hand as you may already know, eukaryotes are organisms
            that have a nucleus which where the DNA is located.</p>

        <h4>Eukaryotic cells</h4>

        <p>
            One of the most important aspects which differentiats them from prokaryotes is the presens of the nucleaus which holds the
            genetic materials and which is considered one of the biggest organel in most of the human cells
            (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600468/" target="_blank">READ MORE HERE NCBI</a>).


            The role of the nucleus in these cells is to both protect and store the genetic material
            as well as the having the roll to control gene expression as most of the processes take place here with one
            exception which is the gene translation (process which takes place in the cytoplasm)
            (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9845/#:~:text=The%20presence%20of%20a%20nucleus,as%20the%20cell's%20control%20center." target="_blank">NCBI</a>).</p>
        </p>
        <p> One other important aspect is the presence of types of group cells which are:
            <ol>
        <li> Somatic cells: Somatic cells are produced by cell division called mitosis, which in multicellular organisms are
            differentiated into specialized cell types. </li>
        <li> Sex cells: Sex cells are specialized cells used for reproduction, aspect valid only for organisms that use sexual reproduction.
            The process is called meiosis and will be discussed later. For example all mammales reproduce sexually, while
            in some reptile and fish species parthenogenesis can occur.
            In plants the sexual cells are referred to as gametes.

    </ol>
