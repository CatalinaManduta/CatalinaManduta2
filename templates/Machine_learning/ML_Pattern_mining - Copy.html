            <h3>What is Frequent Pattern Mining?</h3>
            <p>
                Frequent pattern mining in machine learning is a process used to find patterns that appear often within a dataset.
                Imagine you have a large collection of data, like a list of things people buy from a store. Frequent pattern
                mining helps identify items that frequently appear together, like bread and butter, which are commonly bought together.
                In simple terms, it's about discovering which combinations or sequences of things show up regularly in a set of
                data. This is useful in understanding relationships between different items or events, such as in
                gene co-expression patterns, risk factor identification, or health behavior patterns.

            <!-- Sets Section -->
            <h3>Sets</h3>
            <p>Before diving into the subject, there are a few important concepts to introduce:</p>

            <!-- Definitions -->
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Extensional Definitions:</strong> These are helpful when you have a limited, manageable number of elements in a biological set,
                    and you can explicitly list them. For example, you might define the set of bird species in a specific park as:
                    <code>S = {sparrow, eagle, pigeon, robin}</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intensional Definitions:</strong> These are useful for describing larger or infinite sets based on a rule or condition.
                    For instance, to define all bird species with a wingspan greater than 1 meter:
                    <code>S = {x ∈ Birds | x’s wingspan > 1 meter}</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Set Properties -->
            <h3>Set Properties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Uniqueness:</strong> In a set, each element is unique. This prevents confusion and ensures clarity in data analysis.
                    For example, if you're tracking influenza cases, each patient appears only once in the set.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Well-Definedness:</strong> A set must be well-defined, meaning that for any element, you can clearly determine
                    whether it belongs to the set. For example, <code>D = {all individuals with a fasting blood sugar level > 126 mg/dL}</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Order Irrelevance:</strong> The order of elements in a set doesn't matter.
                    For instance, <code>{A, B, C}</code> is the same as <code>{C, B, A}</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Finite vs. Infinite Sets:</strong> A finite set has a specific, countable number of elements, while an infinite set doesn't.
                    For example, <code>C = {100,000 infected individuals}</code> is finite, but <code>S = {all future humans at risk for a novel virus}</code> is infinite.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subset:</strong> A subset contains elements that are all part of a larger set.
                    For example, <code>T ⊆ H</code> means every element in <code>T</code> is also in <code>H</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Empty Set (∅):</strong> An empty set contains no elements.
                    For instance, if no individuals in a study have a particular mutation, the set of affected individuals is <code>∅</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cardinality:</strong> Cardinality is the number of elements in a set.
                    For example, if <code>T = {John, Anna, Maria, ...}</code>, the cardinality of the set would be the total number of individuals, say 10,000.
                </li>
            </ul>

     <h3>Sets proprieties</h3>
    <p> Classical genetics focuses on how traits (phenotypes) are passed down and how they work, without
        needing to know the specific details about the genes, proteins, or other molecules involved. It's like figuring
        out how something works by observing what you can see (like physical traits or behaviors) without needing to
        understand the inner workings or the exact parts that make it happen.

            <p>Phenotype is what you can see or measure in an organism, like its eye color, height, or how it behaves.
                It's how the genes and environment together make the organism look or act.

        <h4>Cell biology</h4>

        <p>Even though it is not necessary to understand cell biology to be able to understand classical genetics,
            this would be a great start in order to have a deeper understanding of the subject.
        <p>There are two big groups of organisms:</p>
        <p><strong>Prokaryotes:</strong> These are the organisms whose cells do not have a nucleus.
            Because of that, their DNA floats freely cell's cytoplasm.</p>
        <p><strong>Eukaryotes:</strong> On the other hand as you may already know, eukaryotes are organisms
            that have a nucleus which where the DNA is located.</p>

        <h4>Eukaryotic cells</h4>

            One of the most important aspects which differentiats them from prokaryotes is the presens of the nucleaus which holds the
            genetic materials and which is considered one of the biggest organel in most of the human cells
            (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600468/" target="_blank">READ MORE HERE NCBI</a>).


            The role of the nucleus in these cells is to both protect and store the genetic material
            as well as the having the roll to control gene expression as most of the processes take place here with one
            exception which is the gene translation (process which takes place in the cytoplasm)
            (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9845/#:~:text=The%20presence%20of%20a%20nucleus,as%20the%20cell's%20control%20center." target="_blank">NCBI</a>).</p>
        </p>
        <p> One other important aspect is the presence of types of group cells which are:
            <ol>
        <li> Somatic cells: Somatic cells are produced by cell division called mitosis, which in multicellular organisms are
            differentiated into specialized cell types. </li>
        <li> Sex cells: Sex cells are specialized cells used for reproduction, aspect valid only for organisms that use sexual reproduction.
            The process is called meiosis and will be discussed later. For example all mammales reproduce sexually, while
            in some reptile and fish species parthenogenesis can occur.
            In plants the sexual cells are referred to as gametes.
