            <h3>What is Linear Regression? </h3>
            <p>Linear regression is a method used to build a model that shows how a result depends on one or more factors.
        If there's only one factor influencing the result, it’s called simple linear regression. If several factors are involved,
        it’s called multiple linear regression. This line helps show how one factor (called the independent variable) affects another
        (called the dependent variable).

    <h3>Behind the Scenes: How Linear Regression Works</h3>
    <h4>Step 1: Understanding the Goal</h4>
    <p>
        In linear regression, we’re looking to find the "best fit" line through our data points. This line is described by the equation:
        <code>y = mx + b</code>, where:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>y</strong> is the dependent variable (output we’re predicting).</li>
        <li><strong>x</strong> is the independent variable (input).</li>
        <li><strong>m</strong> is the slope of the line (how steep the line is).</li>
        <li><strong>b</strong> is the intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our task is to find values for <strong>m</strong> and <strong>b</strong> that make this line best represent our data points.</p>

    <h4>Step 2: Visualizing the Data</h4>
    <p>
        If we plot our points: (1, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 5), we see that these points almost form a straight line,
        hinting that a linear relationship might be a good fit.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3: Calculating the Slope (<i>m</i>)</h4>
    <p>The slope <strong>m</strong> tells us how much <strong>y</strong> changes when <strong>x</strong> increases by 1. Here’s how we calculate it:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Calculate the average of the <strong>x</strong> values and the average of the <strong>y</strong> values:
            <ul>
                <li>Average of x = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2</li>
                <li>Average of y = (3 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 4</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Calculate how much each x and y value deviates from their averages:
            <ul>
                <li>For x: deviations are (1 - 2), (2 - 2), (3 - 2) → -1, 0, +1</li>
                <li>For y: deviations are (3 - 4), (4 - 4), (5 - 4) → -1, 0, +1</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Multiply each x deviation by its corresponding y deviation and add up the products:
            <ul>
                <li>(-1)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Sum the squares of the x deviations:
            <ul>
                <li>(-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Divide the total from step 3 by the total from step 4 to get the slope: <strong>m = 2 / 2 = 1</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>This tells us that for every 1-unit increase in x, y increases by 1.</p>

    <h4>Step 4: Calculating the Intercept (<i>b</i>)</h4>
    <p>The intercept <strong>b</strong> tells us the starting point of our line when x = 0. Here’s how we calculate it:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>We already have the averages of x and y, which are 2 and 4, respectively.</li>
        <li>
            Plug the averages and slope m into the line equation to solve for b:
            <ul>
                <li>4 = (1)(2) + b</li>
                <li>b = 4 - 2 = 2</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So, our intercept <strong>b</strong> is 2.</p>

    <h4>Final Equation</h4>
    <p>Putting it all together, our best-fit line equation is: <code>y = 1x + 2</code>.</p>

    <h4>Step 5: Understanding Why This Equation is "Best"</h4>
    <p>
        This line minimizes the distances between the line and each data point in a vertical direction (these distances are called errors or residuals).
        In linear regression, we choose <strong>m</strong> and <strong>b</strong> values that make the total squared error as small as possible,
        which gives us the most accurate line for predicting <strong>y</strong> values based on <strong>x</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>Intuition</h4>
    <p>
        Let’s say we’re studying the effect of sunlight on plant height. Imagine we collect data from three plants with different sunlight exposure per day
        (for example, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours) and measure their heights (say, 10 cm, 14 cm, and 18 cm).
        Using linear regression, we’re looking to find a line that best represents the relationship between sunlight and plant height. This line won’t
        necessarily pass through every point, but it will capture the overall trend.
    </p>

    <h4>Summary of Key Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Slope (m):</strong> Shows how much y changes with each unit of x.</li>
        <li><strong>Intercept (b):</strong> Shows where the line starts when x = 0.</li>
        <li><strong>Best fit:</strong> Achieved by minimizing the squared error, balancing the line across the points.</li>
    </ul>
