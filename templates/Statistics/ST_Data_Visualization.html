    <h3>What is Data Visualization?</h3>
    <p>
        Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data such as charts, graphs, and maps.
        It helps to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in a dataset.
    </p>

    <h3>Comparative Graphs</h3>
    <p>Graphs in this category are used to compare quantities, categories, or trends across different groups.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Bar Chart:</strong> Used to compare quantities across categories.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Comparing the average height of plants grown under different light conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stacked Area Chart:</strong> Visualizes the cumulative composition of different groups over time.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Tracking the proportion of different plankton species in a lake ecosystem across seasons.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="white-box">
    <h3>Distribution Graphs</h3>
    <p>These graphs show how data is distributed, making it easier to identify patterns, outliers, and variability.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Histogram:</strong> Displays the frequency distribution of data.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Showing the distribution of leaf sizes in a population of oak trees.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Box Plot:</strong> Summarizes data distribution and identifies outliers.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Displaying the range of enzyme activity in a sample of bacterial cultures under varying pH levels.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Violin Plot:</strong> Combines box plot and density plot to show the distribution of data.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Comparing the spread of protein concentrations across multiple cell types.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="white-box">
    <h3>Proportional Graphs</h3>
    <p>These graphs are used to represent parts of a whole or proportions within datasets.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Pie Chart:</strong> Represents proportions within a whole.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Illustrating the proportion of different blood types in a study group.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="white-box">
    <h3>Relational Graphs</h3>
    <p>Relational graphs show relationships or correlations between variables in a dataset.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Scatter Plot:</strong> Displays relationships between two numerical variables.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Examining the correlation between nutrient concentration and plant growth rate.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bubble Chart:</strong> An extension of the scatter plot, where the size of the bubbles represents a third variable.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Exploring relationships between animal species' body size, population density, and habitat area.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Network Graph:</strong> Displays relationships or interactions between entities.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Mapping protein-protein interactions in a biological pathway.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="white-box">
    <h3>Temporal Graphs</h3>
    <p>These graphs are designed to show changes or trends over time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Line Graph:</strong> Shows trends over time or continuous data.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Monitoring changes in population size of a species over several months.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="white-box">
    <h3>Pattern and Density Graphs</h3>
    <p>Graphs in this category highlight patterns, clusters, or variations in datasets.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Heatmap:</strong> Represents data values as colors, often used to show patterns or correlations.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Visualizing gene expression levels across different samples in a study.
        </li>
    </ul>
