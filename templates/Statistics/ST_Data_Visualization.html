    <h3>What is Data Visualization?</h3>
    <p>
        Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data such as charts, graphs, and maps.
        It helps to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in a dataset.
    </p>

    <h3>Comparative Graphs</h3>
    <p>Graphs in this category are used to compare quantities, categories, or trends across different groups.</p>
    <h4>Bar Chart</h4>
    <p>Used to compare quantities across categories.</p>
    <p> <strong>Example:</strong> Comparing the average height of plants grown under different light conditions. </p>

            </ul>
    <h4> Barplot </h4>
    <p>Imagine you have different fertilizers A, B, C and D and you would like to see the average growth of a set
    of plants using a barplot based on the different fertilizers used.
    <strong> Please note, this is dummy data! </strong> </p>
